<h2><u>
Synopsis
</u></h2>

The ketogenic diet, or keto diet, when abbreviated, is a high fat diet that offers can offer health benefits.<br>
Studies have shown that this type of diet can help you lose weight and improve your health.<br>
Ketogenic diets may even provide benefits against certain disease such as diabetes, cancer, epilepsy, and Alzheimerâ€™s disease.<br>    

<h2><u>
The Basics
</u></h2>

The keto diet is a very low carb, high fat diet that focuses on replacing the first macronutrient with the second. This<br>
causes a certain process in the body called ketosis, where fat becomes the primary source of energy.<br>
Ketogenic diets are believed to reduce blood sugar and insulin levels. This and the increased amount of ketones
can provide some health benefits. However, there is a complication called ketoacidosis that can come about from<br>
too many ketones in the blood, causing it to become acidic. <br>

<h2><u>
Types of Keto Diets:
</u></h2>

There are several versions, some of which are listed below:<br>
<ul>
    <li> Ketogenic diet (SKD): This version is a very low carb, moderate protein and high fat diet. It generally comprises of 70% fat, 20% protein, and only 10% carbs.</li><br>
    <li> Cyclical ketogenic diet (CKD): This variation of the diet involves carb refeeding days, where you can have some more carbs and then go back to the keto diet.</li><br>
    <li> Targeted ketogenic diet (TKD): This variation allows for carbohydrates around when you work out.</li><br>
    <li> High protein ketogenic diet: This version of the keto diet is more protein-oriented, where protein comprises 35% of the diet, fat 60%, and carbs 5%.</li><br>
</ul>

<h2><u>
What is Ketosis?
</u></h2>

Ketosis is a metabolic state where your body switches to using fat as a primary source and not carbs. By reducing<br>
reduing your carb intake, your body is not able to readily use glucose as an energy source, and thus breaks fat down <br>
into ketones as an alternate source of energy. Important to know for ketosis is that protein can be turned into glucose<br>
so it is important to limit protein to prevent that. Interestingly, ketosis can be measured by various tests and certain <br>
symptoms like dry mouth or increased thirst. <br>
