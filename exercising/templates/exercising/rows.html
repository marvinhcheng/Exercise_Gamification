<h2><u>
Synopsis
</u></h2>
Rows are a good workout for strengthening your upper and lower back muscles, in addition to a few others in your<br>
arms, and your core muscles. As you may be able to guess, it simulates the same kind of motion that you would get<br>
from rowing a boat. <br>


<h2><u>
The Basics
</u></h2>
Rows are a good "pull" exercise, in comparison to the many other common "push" exercises mentioned here and elsewhere.<br>
It is an important exercise to help provide further stability to your core by strenghening your back muscles. Many variations<br>
on the rows exercise exist, so the guideline below is for one-arm dumbbell rows. <br>

<ol>
    <li>Select a weight that you think would be maintanable for around 10 reps</li>
    <li>Stand with your feet about hip-width apart</li>
    <li>Stand in a lunge position and lean forward with your back foot being straightened</li>
    <li>Place the arm that is not lifting on your thigh or on a bench to keep balance</li>
    <li>While ensuring your core is steady, keep your elbow close to your ribs when youre holding the weight</li>
    <li>Slowly lower the weight by moving only your shoulder blades until your arm is fully extended</li>
    <li>Drive your elbow upwards while still keeping your elbow close to your ribs until the weight gets to chest level</li>
    <li>At this point, really squeeze your back muscles so that you can really feel them engaged</li>
    <li>Repeat this about 10 times for 3 sets for each arm</li>
</ol>
    
    
<h2><u>
Variations
</u></h2>
There are many types of row exercises, which are including but not limited to: <br>
    
<ul>
    <li>Single Dumbbell: Using one dumbbell at a time to really feel the motion</li>
    <li>Double Dumbbell: Using two dumbells at the same time to balance</li>
    <li>Barbell: Balancing a barball across both hands and performing a similar motion to the dumbbells</li>
    <li>Machine: Some machines have you sitting and rowing, which looks very similar to actual rowing</li>
    <li>Resistance bands: It is also possible to use resistance bands to perform this exercise <br>
        by sitting with your legs straight forward and having the band be held by your feet while you <br>
        pull back on the band with both arms. 
    </li>

</ul>
